Servlet Data
=================================================

These demos illustrate how to share in-memory data between servlets using embedded Jetty.

## Library Setup ##

This project has two additional third-party libraries setup in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file. There are three dependencies added for Jetty and servlets. There are also a few optional Apache libraries included: the [Apache Log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) library, the [Apache Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) library, and the [Apache Commons Text](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/) library. 

Eclipse should automatically download the required `jar` files for these third-party libraries when you first import the code. It may take a few moments for the download to complete. If not, right-click the `pom.xml` file, go to the "Maven" menu, and select "Update Project..." from the submenu.
